        The Avengers disagree on how to approach Loki and become argumentative once they realize S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to use the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction for use against hostile extraterrestrials. During the argument, Loki's agents attack the Helicarrier, and the stress causes Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers restart the damaged engine while Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff subdues Barton, freeing him from Loki's influence. Loki escapes after mortally wounding Coulson. Fury uses Coulson's subsequent death to motivate the Avengers to work together as a team. Loki uses the Tesseract and a generator Selvig built to open a wormhole above Stark Tower in New York City to bring his Chitauri fleet and start his invasion.
